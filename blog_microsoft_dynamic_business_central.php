                                <p>Finally, Business Central would not be possible without the amazing team that is behind this great product.

                                <p>Because Dynamics 365 Business Central and Dynamics NAV run the same application code base, this empowers us to smoothly transition all our Dynamics NAV partners and customers into Dynamics 365 Business Central. Dynamics 365 Business Central is a cloud first solution, designed for the age of digital transformation powered by the cloud. But it will not be a cloud only solution. In the fall it will be available for self-deployment on premise and in the intelligent edge for customers that prefer that option. For the existing partners and customers, this will be just another upgrade, like they would do for Dynamics NAV, with a name change. For customers interested in the cloud, starting today, Dynamics 365 Business Central offers unprecedented opportunities to drive transformation of the customers&rsquo; businesses, increasing their business performance through the power of Microsoft cloud technologies and services.</p>
