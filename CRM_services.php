                <h3>Cost Accounting</h3>

                Cost accounting lets you collect data from various sources, such as the general ledger, sub-ledgers, budgets, and statistical

                information. You can then analyse, summarise, and evaluate cost data, so that management can make the best

                possible decisions for price updates, budgets, cost control, and so on. The source data that is used for

                cost analysis is treated independently in Cost accounting.

              </li>

              <li class="list-group-item">

                <h3>Fixed Assets</h3>

                You can set up and enter acquisition information for fixed assets, and then manage them by depreciating them and setting

                a capitalisation threshold to determine depreciation. You can calculate adjustments to the fixed assets,

                and also dispose of them. When you use General ledger together with Fixed assets, you can view the current

                value of all fixed assets.

                <br>

                <br> The way in which fixed assets are handled must correspond to both international accounting standards and

                the accounting legislation in each country/region. Requirements might include rules for recording acquisition

                and disposal transactions, depreciation, lifetimes, and write-ups and write-downs of fixed assets. The Fixed

                assets functionality incorporates many of these standards and rules.

              </li>

              <li class="list-group-item">

                <h3>General Ledger</h3>

                You can allocate, or distribute, monetary amounts to one or more accounts or account and dimension combinations based on

                allocation rules. Maintain fixed and variable assets. You can also settle transactions between ledger accounts

                and revalue currency amounts.

                <br>

                <br> At the end of a fiscal year, generate closing transactions and prepare your accounts for the next fiscal

                year. Consolidate and combine the financial results for several subsidiary legal entities into results for

                a single, consolidated organisation.

                <br>

                <br> A project is a group of activities that is designed to provide a service, produce a product, or achieve
