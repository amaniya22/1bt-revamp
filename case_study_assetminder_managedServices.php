                <p class="dropcap">Assetminder is a cloud-based fleet maintenance and workshop management system that was awarded the prestigious
                  Innovation Award at the recent 2017 Fleet Transport awards in Dublin. It was built ground up into a comprehensive
                  platform. The previous version of the Assetminder application, known as Fleetminder, was designed and developed
                  as a client-server application.</p>

                The Fleetminder application has been adopted by enterprises across Ireland for fleet maintenance and workshop management.
                The support services for this application was initially carried out within the company.

                  <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                  <p>Upon the successful launch of the application, Assetminder gathered traction and numerous enterprises signed
                    up to obtain the service. Furthermore, majority of the existing Fleetminder clients migrated to Assetminder
                    to reap benefits of the cloud-based application with upgraded features.</p>

                  To cope up with the traction received and to ensure a smooth transition, Assetminder Limited (owners of Assetminder and Fleetminder)
                  required a strong team with the right expertise to provide support services for their clients.

                      will maintain the communication link with the end user to get any further information regarding the
                      issue or to update the user of the progress on the issue.

                      hours of the day in Ireland to minimize interference to live operations.
