                <p class="dropcap">There is a growing clamour for corporations to innovate across their products, markets and customer offerings.

                  As a result of globalization, in order to survive, companies have to go beyond the norm by investing in

                  product innovation, market research, scientific testing and quality analysis to develop high-quality products

                  at the lowest cost while bringing them to the market in the shortest possible time. A company that found

                  success in streamlined testing, Auxenta, is instrumental in assisting organizations to ride the wave of

                  innovation. Establishing its credentials in quality management and testing services, Auxenta is helping

                  telcos, financial services and independent software vendors to deliver flawless products and services with

                  an enhanced customer experience. As a result of its clearly superior solutions, Auxenta was featured in

                  the ‘CIO Review’ amongst ‘20 most promising quality management solutions providers of 2017’.</p>



                <p> A key strength of Auxenta is its ability to assess the maturity of QA processes through a strong set of quality

                  consultancy services. Its test automation frameworks and tools empower non-technical QA engineers to develop

                  test automation scripts, which act as an accelerator for test automation with improved quality. The company

                  is investing in building teams with high-end QA and testing skills. </p>



                <p> Chandana Ranasinghe – Co-Founder and COO of Auxenta elaborates: “Auxenta’s open source-based solution possesses

                  the capability to build tools that can meet specific test automation needs. Using SpecFlow, Auxenta’s test

                  automation framework defines, manages, and automatically executes human-readable acceptance tests using

                  behavior driven development and testing (BDD) technique. It describes the behavior of clients’ systems

                  using human-readable syntax, which is then bound to the application code to automate the testing of the

                  system. Based on the current maturity level, Auxenta develops a roadmap for the client and systematically

                  leverages Test Maturity Model integration (TMMi) to enable a testing center of excellence and establish

                  or enhance the QA CoE.”</p>



                <p> Auxenta’s quality management and testing services facilitate a wide range of testing solutions to achieve

                  never-before cost-effective software products. The company’s diverse testing services comprises of several

                  core offerings designed to complement an organization’s existing quality assurance activities, including

                  test automation, performance testing, mobile application testing, and enterprise QA services. Auxenta assists

                  clients to streamline API testing for a smarter and faster delivery as enterprises increasingly convert

                  their traditional single-tier applications to multi-tier API-based applications.</p>



                <p> The company proved its expertise while helping an Asian telco to export over 1,000 internal APIs. The client

                  was facing major hurdles while exporting the APIs as a service – since each of them had to go through a

                  series of tests before being exposed to the market. The client’s traditional methods of manual testing

                  were taking up to one year. Taking on the challenge, Auxenta developed a state-of-the-art API test automation

                  tool specifically for this requirement and was able to automate the testing of more than 1,000 APIs. This

                  tool not only brought down the time taken for testing from one year to less than a month, but it also enabled

                  reusable capability. As a result of Auxenta’s expertise, the telco now possesses the ability to modify

                  the developed APIs, revamp the tools, and instantly certify the APIs – helping them drastically reduce

                  issues for end customers.</p>



                <p> Auxenta’s proven QA framework boasts cutting-edge methodology and innovative QA tools. These are aimed at

                  increasing the capacity of organizations, such as independent software providers as well as in-house clients’

                  end customers, to meet market demands while sustaining high quality. Auxenta’s vast portfolio not only

                  covers consultation and development services for mobile applications, but also spans software development

                  and testing services in all areas such as .NET and Java. </p>



                <p> By leveraging Microsoft Dynamics’ line of software applications, the company has further demonstrated expertise

                  in functional consultancy as well as application development in CRM and ERP platforms. As a forerunner

                  in innovation, Auxenta pioneered a Bitcoin-based solution in Sri Lanka using Block-chain Technology. </p>
