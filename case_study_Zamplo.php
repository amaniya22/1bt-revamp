                  <h3>The Challenge</h3><br>
                  <p>The application was expected to be developed using React Native Web & Node JS, whilst React Native was a cross platform framework, which was relatively new to the industry. As such, the biggest challenge faced by 1 Billion Tech was to build an inhouse React Native Web expert group. The development team assigned to the project gave its fullest commitment and showed remarkable hard work in successfully mastering this technology and proceding with the project work as expected.<br><br>

                    The application also uses commonly available medical and healthcare related APIs (Clinical Trials, Surveys, etc.) to provide extended features to patients. Integrating with such APIs and only enabling applicable information to respective users was a challenge that was overcome through extensive R&D.<br><br>

                    Also, ensuring the application is cross browser and cross platform compatible for both Web and Mobile (Android, iOS, etc.) for various commonly used devices was a challenge entrusted to the Dev and QA teams. </p>

                <h3>HOW 1 BILLION TECH HELPED</h3><br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A highly skilled offshore team was groomed with the required technical capabilities (React Native Web) within a 4-week window and was deployed to gain domain expertise. </li>
                    <li>During phases of lack of clarity in client requirements, 1 Billion Tech played the role of BA/SME, providing suggestions and recommendations for improvement of the overall usability as well as the user experience of the application.</li>
                    <li> A QA team with an eye for quality, attentive to the most minute of details to be tested was in place with quality assured. 0 UAT findings.</li>
                    <li> A detailed project management and status reporting dashboard via Jira and daily/weekly status reports and calls.</li>
                    <li>Flexibility of change in requirements without impacting the quality of deliverables.</li>
                    <li> Highly skilled, dedicated, and experienced offshore team.</li>
