                  <h3>The Challenge</h3><br>
                  <p>1 Billion Tech is engaged by the client to build a fully-fledged cloud native software platform for institutional fund managers to digitize its product/service offerings. In addition to the product development work, 1 Billion Tech also provides testing services, which originally commenced with manual testing. 
<br><br>
Needless to say, performing manual testing for projects that have complex workflows (in this case, roughly 750 steps) is a time consuming and cumbersome process. The client had four (04) such end-to-end regression workflows with nearly 3,000 manual steps that the team had to follow during each regression.
</p>

                <div class="padding-top-15">
                  <h3>How 1 Billion Tech helped</h3><br>
                
                  <p>The client wanted 1 Billion Tech to help automate its manual testing process in order to increase testing productivity and the coverage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leveraging the <strong>1 Billion Tech open source BDD Framework</strong> [1], we helped the client to automate the four (04) major regression workflows.</p>
<p>The following steps were initiated to help the client:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Allocating a specialized automation engineer who is highly skilled and experienced in test automation.</li><br>
<li>The existing manual test cases were detailed out to identify all possible automation steps, which basically gave a clear visibility to the client on the automation scope.&nbsp;</li><br>
<li>A detailed <strong>test automation architecture</strong> document was given to the client to give them a comprehensive architectural overview of the proposed test automation solution.</li><br>

<li>All end-to-end regression workflows were automated within the agreed time frame, which comprised of a fully <strong>automated test suite</strong> with more than 3,000 automation steps including all verification points.&nbsp;</li><br>
<li>Finally, the automation framework was integrated with extent reports, and this gave a comprehensive <strong>test execution report</strong> to the client to analyze test results in an efficient manner.</li><br>
</ol>
<p>The following diagram (figure 1) shows the conceptual architecture of our test automation framework.</p>

                <h3>BENEFITS TO THE CLIENT</h3><br>
                  <ul>
<li>Reduction in test execution time by 70% for the defined regression scope.&nbsp;</li><br>
<li>Low maintenance effort due to handling object properties and test data separately in Excel sheets. This helped avoid changes at the script/code level to run the scripts on a different version of the application.&nbsp;</li><br>
<li>With the use of the Cucumber BDD approach, client-side test engineers were also able to quickly grasp knowledge by maintaining existing scripts due to any object property changes of the screen on the same path.&nbsp;</li><br>
<li>30% effort reduction on any future script automations (outside of this registration flow) due to the reusable methods that have been implemented.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
