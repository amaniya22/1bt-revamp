                  Bitcoin Bazaar was developed for a bay area startup named Bay Coins, LLC. The requirement was for a crypto-currency
                  trading platform where crypto-currency can be traded seamlessly with integrated location services and a
                  high degree of safety for the users.

                <h3>HOW 1 BILLION TECH HELPED</h3>
                  <p>We worked closely with the client to first understand the blockchain technology and analysed other cryptocurrencies
                    at that time. Upon narrowing it down to focusing on Bitcoin, the team set out to create this trading
                    platform ground-up while addressing all the client needs. This application was a first of its kind as
                    there were no mobile based bitcoin trading platform at the time. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="padding-top-15">
                  <h3>The Solution</h3>
                  <p>Developed a Cryptocurrency trading platform where users can trade Bitcoin within a specific location or
                    via online. Location and user-based search algorithms to improve on search result accuracy. A mobile
                    trading platform that runs on iOS and Android. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="padding-top-15">
                  <h3>BENEFITS TO CLIENT</h3>
                  <p>A unified mobile solution which allows users to trade Bitcoin in a safe and secure manner. The client also
                    received a product that was one of the first of its kind as it was on both iOS and Android platforms.
                    <br>
                    <br> 1 Billion Tech co founder and CTO Dr. Shahani Markus, who is also CTO of Bay Coins said, “Mobile is a natural
                    fit for those who want to trade Bitcoins, and buying or selling with cash is still the easiest way to
                    acquire the currency. In the past, finding someone near you to transact with wasn’t easy with mobile
                    devices. With Bitcoin Bazaar, anyone can buy or sell Bitcoin in person easily.” Dr. Markus, a Computer
                    Science Ph.D. from Purdue University, and former CTO of the ICT Agency of Sri Lanka.
